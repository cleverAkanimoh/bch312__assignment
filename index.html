				<p class="first-text">Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder in which there is copper poisoning in
					the body. It is also known as <strong>hepatolenticular degeneration and progressive lenticular
						degeneration</strong>. Copper is essential in developing healthy bones, nerves, collagen, and
					melanin.</p>
				<p>Wilson's disease (WD), which results from the defective ATP7B protein product, is characterized by
					impaired copper metabolism and its clinical consequences vary from an asymptomatic state to
					fulminant hepatic failure, chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, neurological, and
					psychiatric manifestations. A high grade of suspicion is warranted to not miss cases of WD,
					especially less florid cases with only mild elevation of transaminases, or isolated neuropsychiatric
					involvement. Screening in first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory, and treatment must
					commence upon establishment of diagnosis. Treatment strategies include chelators such as
					D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as inductors of methallothioneins, which favor a
					negative copper balance and a reduction of free plasmatic copper. As an orphan disease, research is
					lacking in this field, especially regarding therapeutic strategies which are associated with better
					patient compliance and which could eventually also reverse established injury.</p>
				<p>
					In Wilson's disease, copper isn't eliminated properly and instead accumulates, possibly to a
					life-threatening level. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 12 and 23.
					Symptoms include swelling, fatigue, abdominal pain and uncontrolled or poorly coordinated movements.
					Treatment often includes medication that can prompt the organs to release copper into the
					bloodstream.
					Once it's in the bloodstream, it can then be eliminated from the body through the kidneys.

				<p>Wilson's disease is present at birth, but signs and symptoms don't appear until the copper builds up in the brain, liver or other organ. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the parts of your body affected by the disease. They can include:</p>
				<ul id="symptoms_list">
					<li>Fatigue, lack of appetite or abdominal pain</li>
					<li>A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye (jaundice)</li>
					<li>Golden-brown eye discoloration (Kayser-Fleischer rings)</li>
					<li>Fluid buildup in the legs or abdomen</li>
					<li>Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination</li>
					<li>Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness</li>
					<li></li>
