					<p class="first-text">Wilson's disease is brought on by copper toxicity, which is necessary for
						collagen, melanin, healthy bones, and neurons. A deficiency in copper removal, which results in
						swelling, exhaustion, stomach discomfort, and uncontrollable movements, is the cause of Wilson's
						illness.</p>

					<p>Wilson's disease (WD), which is defined by poor copper metabolism, can have a range of clinical
						effects, including asymptomatic states all the way up to fulminant hepatic failure, chronic
						liver disease with or without cirrhosis, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms. It is
						required to screen the first and second degree relatives of index cases, and treatment must
						start as soon as a diagnosis is made. Chelators like D-penicillamine and trientine are used as
						treatment options, while zinc salts function as methallothionein inducers, which promote a
						negative copper balance and a decrease in free plasmatic copper. In this area, there is a
						shortage of research.</p>

					<figcaption>&circeq; Slide showing reactions involved in wilson's disease</figcaption>

					<p>Wilson illness is brought on by flaws in the copper homeostasis-related P-type ATPase protein.
						These mutations, which can result in elevated tissue copper levels, oxidative stress, and cell
						damage, are present in the majority of organs, including the liver, kidney, and placenta. The
						same gene mutation can result in a variety of symptoms in clinical situations, and WD may also
						emerge as a result of genetic alteration, lipid metabolism, and environmental variables. Around
						95% of the copper in plasma is located in a copper-containing protein called ceruloplasmin. In
						particular, it is crucial for oxidizing Fe++ to Fe+++ and avoiding the creation of hazardous
						iron compounds in order to preserve the ionic state of iron.</p>
					<p>The Ceruloplasmin protein, which is responsible for 95% of the copper contained in the plasma,
						absorbs copper from meals and excretes it into the bile. Oral contraceptives, pregnancy,
						inflammatory or viral processes, and oral contraceptives are some of the factors that might
						increase copper levels.</p>

					<figcaption>&circeq; Slide showing some symptoms of wilson's disease</figcaption>

					<p>Wilson's disease is present from birth, but it doesn't show any signs or symptoms until copper
						levels in the brain, liver, or another organ start to rise. Depending on the areas of your body
						that the illness has damaged, your signs and symptoms will change. They may consist of:</p>

					<ul id="symptoms_list">
						<li>Fatigue, lack of appetite or abdominal pain</li>
						<li>A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye (jaundice)</li>
						<li>Golden-brown eye discoloration (Kayser-Fleischer rings)</li>
						<li>Fluid buildup in the legs or abdomen</li>
						<li>Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination</li>
						<li>Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness</li>
						<li>Swelling of legs and abdomen</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>prevention</h2>
					<p>If WD is identified early on, it can be successfully treated pharmacologically as a metabolic
						condition. By screening first-degree relatives of patients with WD and doing a differential
						diagnostic to rule out other liver and movement problems, an early diagnosis of WD can be made.
						Siblings of an index case are those most at risk for developing WD, and regardless of age, a
						prompt diagnosis is required. The typical limits of copper metabolism parameters in infants and
						young children are not well defined, and genetic screening is not always accessible or
						conclusive. Careful clinical monitoring is required to support the WD diagnosis.</p>

			<section id="treatments" class="section">
				<div class="title">
					<h2>treatments / case study</h2>
					<p>Treatment for Wilson's disease includes medications and surgery, which may be necessary in some
						cases. These medicines are chelating agents that bind copper into the bloodstream, where the
						organs release it out through the bloodstream. Treatment then focuses on preventing the build-up
						of copper in the body again. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to restore normalcy, but if
						left untreated, it may cause brain damage and liver failure.</p>

					<article id="cases">
						<p>below are some cases of wilson's disease found during secondary research of wilson's disease.
							These case studies will help us further understand how wilson's disease affects one in a
							real life scenerio</p>
						<div class="title">
							<h2>case 1</h2>
							<p>After two days, a Muslim child who was the product of a second-degree consanguineous union was hospitalized with acute epistaxis and abdominal distension. The youngest of four siblings, he had a respectable academic record. During examination, it was discovered that the infant had no pallor but had a low-grade fever, acute icterus, pedal oedema, hepatomegaly, and ascitis. Investigation results showed total and differential leucocyte counts along with bilateral KF rings and hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL. The direct total serum bilirubin level was 23.0 mg/dl.</p>
							<aside class="hidden one">
								<p> He was managed conservatively with blood transfusions, antibiotics and bowel wash. Copper studies could not be carried out due to lack of facilities and patients condition. D-penicillamine was started in a dose of 250 mg twice a day and the child showed marginal improvement but within a month developed hepatic encephalopathy. His liver function tests were normal and copper studios for the sibals were advised.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="title">
							<h2>case 2</h2>
							<p>A second-degree nonsanguinous marriage gave birth to a 15-year-old Hindu girl who was reported to be becoming worse at school and becoming more lethargic. While she had bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings, she had no history of jaundice, involuntary movements, or speech disorders.</p>
							<aside class="hidden two">
								<p>On investigation, her liver functions were within normal limits, and serum and urinary copper studies carried out in Delhi for the patient and family members were as given in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5529699/table/tbl1/" target="_blank" class="design" rel="noopener noreferrer">Table 1</a>. No KF rings were seen on any other member of the family. She was treated with D-penicillaminc 500 mg twice a day for six months, with improvement in her academic performance. Currently, she has been on zinc therapy for the past year with Cap Zevit (61.8 mg zinc) 1 TDS and has shown no deterioration.</p>

						<div class="title">
							<h2>case 3</h2>
							<p>Clinical presentation may be variable, and diagnosis is often aided by clinical and
								biochemical tests. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with acute
								liver failure initially of unclear etiology. Our patient was initially managed for
								presumed drug-induced liver injury but ultimately diagnosed with Wilson disease on the
								basis of clinical presentation, laboratory testing, liver biopsy, quantitative hepatic
								copper, and abnormal genetic testing.</p>
							<aside class="hidden three">
								<p>A 72-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with severe liver failure was not found to have used alcohol, illegal drugs, or over-the-counter health supplements. She first went to a hospital outside the city with acute pancreatitis, but when her liver function declined, doctors decided to do a transjugular liver biopsy. This allowed them to rule out WD and identify steatohepatitis, mild fibrosis 1A/4, cholestasis, and anisonucleosis. While she first received conservative care, she later had problems such as hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, a low state of mind, and increasing jaundice. With growing suspicion of Kayser-Fleischer rings and ambiguous results, the patient's risk of liver failure (WD) grew. Elevated levels of ceruloplasmin (14 mg/dL), 24-hour urine copper excretion (31 g/24 hr), and serum copper (79 g/dL) were observed.</p>

								<p>She had a high quantitative hepatic copper result of 298 g Cu/g. Further laboratory tests for a workup of acute liver failure came up negative. The patient had a liver transplant evaluation, but because of anuric renal failure and hypoxia-related respiratory failure, her condition deteriorated, and she passed away in the critical care unit. A single copy of a point mutation in the ATP7B gene was found to be heterozygous, according to genetic testing by whole-gene sequencing.</p>
