					<p class="first-text">Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder in which there is copper poisoning in
						the body. It is also known as <strong>hepatolenticular degeneration and progressive lenticular
							degeneration</strong>. Copper is essential in developing healthy bones, nerves, collagen, and
						melanin.</p>
					<p>Wilson's disease (WD), which results from the defective ATP7B protein product, is characterized by
						impaired copper metabolism and its clinical consequences vary from an asymptomatic state to
						fulminant hepatic failure, chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, neurological, and
						psychiatric manifestations. A high grade of suspicion is warranted to not miss cases of WD,
						especially less florid cases with only mild elevation of transaminases, or isolated neuropsychiatric
						involvement. Screening in first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory, and treatment must
						commence upon establishment of diagnosis. Treatment strategies include chelators such as
						D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as inductors of methallothioneins, which favor a
						negative copper balance and a reduction of free plasmatic copper. As an orphan disease, research is
						lacking in this field, especially regarding therapeutic strategies which are associated with better
						patient compliance and which could eventually also reverse established injury.</p>
					<p>
						In Wilson's disease, copper isn't eliminated properly and instead accumulates, possibly to a
						life-threatening level. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 12 and 23.
						Symptoms include swelling, fatigue, abdominal pain and uncontrolled or poorly coordinated movements.
						Treatment often includes medication that can prompt the organs to release copper into the
						bloodstream.
						Once it's in the bloodstream, it can then be eliminated from the body through the kidneys.

					<p>Wilson's disease is present at birth, but signs and symptoms don't appear until the copper builds up in the brain, liver or other organ. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the parts of your body affected by the disease. They can include:</p>

					<ul id="symptoms_list">
						<li>Fatigue, lack of appetite or abdominal pain</li>
						<li>A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye (jaundice)</li>
						<li>Golden-brown eye discoloration (Kayser-Fleischer rings)</li>
						<li>Fluid buildup in the legs or abdomen</li>
						<li>Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination</li>
						<li>Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness</li>
						<li>Swelling of legs and abdomen</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Wilson's disease is caused due to heredity. But in order to get this disease, one must inherit the defective gene from both parents. If the defective gene is received from only one parent, one does not develop Wilson's disease but is a carrier of this gene and can pass it on to his/her children.</p>

					<h2>treatments</h2>
					<p>Treatment often includes medication that can prompt the organs to release copper into the bloodstream. Once it's in the bloodstream, it can then be eliminated from the body through the kidneys.</p>
					<p>Treatment for Wilson's disease includes medications and in some severe cases surgery such as liver transplant. In case medicines are prescribed, these have to be taken lifelong. These medicines are chelating agents that bind the copper and then the organs release them into the bloodstream from where the kidneys flush the copper out through urine. Treatment then focuses on preventing the build-up of copper in the body again.</p>
					<p>The earlier the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, the better the chances of a healthy and normal life. Neurological issues and liver damages are reversible with early diagnosis and treatment. At a later stage, the treatment may stop the progression of the disease but the damaging effects cannot be reversed. And if left untreated, it may cause brain damage and liver failure. </p>

					<p>ATP7B is currently believed to be the key culprit gene for WD. Expression of ATP7B is found in most organs with a particularly high level in liver, kidney and placenta. ATP7B encodes the copper transporting P-type ATPase, a very important enzyme for copper transport in the body. Physiologically, ATP7B plays double roles in liver: It participates in copper transporting to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where copper is incorporated into ceruloplasmin and participates the biliary excretion of copper. Mutation of the ATP7B gene is closely linked to the impairment of copper excretion, leading to abnormal deposition of copper in the target organs. Increased tissue copper level may induce a series of harmful biochemical reactions, particularly oxidative stress, which can damage the structure and integrity of mitochondria, leading to cell injury. In the clinical setting, a variety of manifestations in patients with WD may be present; Even in patients with the same gene mutation, the clinical manifestation may be heterogeneous. Apart from the mutation of ATP7B gene, other factors such as additional genetic modification, lipid metabolism, and even the environmental factors may contribute to the development of WD.</p>
					<p>Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder where ceruloplasmin level is decreased. In low Ceruloplasmin, increased unbound copper is toxic to tissues. Ceruloplasmin's physiological role is reduction and oxidation (Redox). This may be an oxidant or antioxidant, depending upon the factor, such as the presence of free Ferric (Fe+++) ions and ferritin-binding sites. Ceruloplasmin is essential for maintaining the ionic state of iron, in particular, oxidizing Fe++ to Fe+++ and preventing the formation of toxic iron products.</p>
					<p>Copper is absorbed from the gastrointestinal system in food. 1.5 to 3 mg/day of dietary copper is safe and adequate for the body. Excess copper is excreted into the bile by the Ceruloplasmin, which is produced by the liver. In the case of deficiency of Ceruloplasmin, copper accumulates in the body. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing protein that accounts for more than 95% of the copper found in the plasma.Copper is bound to Ceruloplasmin (α-2 globulin) with ferroxidase activity. Copper is also transported in plasma loosely bound to albumin. A small fraction of the copper is complexed with amino acids. Excretion of the copper occurs mainly in the bile and a small fraction in the urine (&lt;40 µg/day). Plasma copper is not a reliable indicator of blood copper level. Factors that will give the raised level of copper are: oral contraceptives, pregnancy and inflammation or infectious process.</p>
